# Offline Movie Database In C++
# UEA  

The aim of this assignment is to construct a simple database that loads information about an unspeciﬁed number of movies (or ﬁlms, if you prefer) from a ﬁle (movies.txt) and queries the database to answer a set of six questions (given below). An additional ﬁle of user ratings of these movies (ratings.txt) is also supplied. These ratings should be applied to the movie database (to determine the average ratings of each ﬁlm) before answering the queries.
