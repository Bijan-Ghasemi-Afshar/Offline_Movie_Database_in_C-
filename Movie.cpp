/*
 *  Movie.h and Movie.cpp, which implement the class Movie, and possibly
 * additional support classes or enumerations, as required. A Movie object
 * records the information about a movie provided in the Ô¨Åle movies.txt. It must
 *  have an appropriate set of constructors and accessor methods, and the stream
 *  input and output operators must be overloaded to allow stream based I/O.
 * The full set of relational operators should be implemented,such that a
 * collection of Movie objects could be sorted, in order of release year
 * (movies with the same release year should appear in alphabetical order).
